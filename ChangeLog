* Found the cause of BUG1 and fixed it.
  <BUG1>
  Cause:
  When wengophone is run, it requires a custom $LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
  variable. This variable is also passed to any child processes. So, when
  wengophone tries to run this script (by calling $BROWSER), that variable
  messes with GTK+ libraries.
  
  When running wengophone, LD_LIBRARY_PATH contains "/opt/wengophone/". There
  is a libpng12.so.0 file inside that directory. So, when GTK+ tries to load
  libpng, the wrong library is loaded from wrong place, and the script
  receives an ImportError exception.
  
  Solution 1 (does not work):
  Add one of the following lines before importing gtk:
  del os.environ["LD_LIBRARY_PATH"]
  os.environ["LD_LIBRARY_PATH"]=""
  
  Solution 2 (also does not work):
  Changing the very first line of the script did not work. I tried these
  interpreters:
  #!/bin/env -i python
  #!/bin/env -u LD_LIBRARY_PATH python
  #!/usr/bin/python -E
  
  Solution 3 (should work, but I don't want it):
  Adding a little shell wrapper script should work, but this is against
  browser-selector design of having everything in only one file. So I won't
  implement this solution.
  
  Solution 4 (a hack that actually works):
  This is a somewhat messy hack, but works. If an ImportError exception is
  caught, then the script will check if LD_LIBRARY_PATH var is set. If it is,
  then it will be cleared and the script will call itself (yes, recursive)
  with a new environment (using execvlp()). If that environment variable is
  unset or blank, then the ImportError exception will just be raised again.

2007-07-05: version 0.1
* Initial version. All main features were implemented.
* There is a nasty bug when launching this script from wengophone program.
  <BUG1>
  Summary: Launching this script from wengophone fails when trying to import gtk
  Reporter: Denilson
  Description:
  On my Gentoo system, this script runs perfectly from shell, but not from
  BROWSER variable. Actually, this only happens when trying to launch it from
  wengophone program (launching from googleearth works). This is the message:
  
   Traceback (most recent call last):
