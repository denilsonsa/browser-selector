There are 3 known ways to set the default browser:

* Using BROWSER environment variable
* Inside Gnome, using Gnome Control Panel, stored in gconf
* Inside KDE, using KControl, stored in a plain text file


== Using environment variable ==

Add the following line to your login script (~/.bash_profile or
~/.bashrc):
 export BROWSER=browser-selector


== Inside Gnome ==

=== Using Gnome Control Panel ===

This method is only available if you have Gnome installed.

Run this program:
 gnome-default-applications-properties

=== Using gconf ===

This method can be used by people who don't have Gnome installed, but
at least have gconf and gconf-editor.

Run this program:
 gconf-editor
Then, look for the following folders:
 desktop/gnome/url-handlers/http
 desktop/gnome/url-handlers/https
Edit ''command'' to:
 browser-selector %s
Leave ''enabled'' checked.
Leave ''needs_terminal'' unchecked.


== Inside KDE ==

=== Using KControl ===

Kcontrol/KDE Components/Component Chooser/Web Browser

=== Editing manually ===

Edit this file:
 ~/.kde/share/config/kdeglobals
Add/modify the following line, inside ''[General]'' section:
 BrowserApplication=!browser-selector
